GWT web application as to keep track of time. It reminds you to take a 15 minute break at the end of every hour. The application can be found and used at http://2.dackestatic.appspot.com/

The project was created to test out GWT techniques and to be of personal use. It is possible that I will add settings to make the program generally useful in the future, but nothing is planned. There are many other similar programs out there that do the same job, but better.
 
The project is in the form of an Eclipse project generated by the Eclipse Google Plugin.

The project is licensed under GPL3.

Contact me at daniel.duner@gmail.com if you need the code under a different license or have any questions.
