GWT web application designed to keep track of time. The generated web page reminds you to take a 15 minute break at the end of every hour. The page changes color and plays a wikimedia voice-snippet to get your attention. The application can be found and used at http://2.dackestatic.appspot.com/

The project was created to test out GWT techniques and to be of personal use. It is possible that I will add settings to make the program generally useful in the future, but nothing is planned. There are many other similar programs out there that do the same job, but better.
 
The project is in the form of an Eclipse project generated by the Eclipse Google Plugin.

The project is licensed under GPL3.
